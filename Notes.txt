STEPS to build our code base:

1. First add all the files in the directory 
2. Populate MANIFEST.in with generic data

3. Add config.py file : A configuration module contains constant variables, the path to the directories, and
initial settings. Variables and functions can be accessed by importing this module
into other modules. For instance, the TARGET variable holds the dependent column
name Loan_Status.
Here, specify the path for the packageâ€™s root directory, data directory, train file name,
test file name, features, and path of other files and directories. | import pathllib, os

4. Add data_management.py : This module contains functions required for loading the data, saving serialized ML
model, and loading deserialized ML model using joblib | import config and joblib

5. Add preprocessors.py : This module holds all the fit and transform functions required 
by the sklearn pipeline | import config and sklearn base models

6. Add pipeline.py : In this module, sklearn-pipeline is used. The model can be deployed without a
sklearn-pipeline, but it is recommended to build a sklearn-pipeline. The purpose of
the pipeline is to assemble several steps that can be cross-validated together while
setting different parameters. | import config and preprocessors

7. Add predict.py : A predict.py module loads the saved ML model (.pkl) and makes predictions on the
new data.

8. Add requirements.txt | use pip freeze command to fill the txt

9. Add train_pipeline.py : This module loads the training data and passes it to the pipeline, then saves the
pickle file of the model to the local directory | config, data_management, predirct, preprocesor

10. Add setup.py : To configure and install packages from the source directory, create a setup.py file. It
is specific to the package. PIP will use the setup.py file to install packages. Go to the
directory where the setup.py file is located and install the packages using the pip
install . (period) command. 

11. Add VERSION to your package
